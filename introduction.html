					institution, was established in 1989. Vishal Bharti Sr. Sec. School is
					a new wave Progressive school with the vision and aspiration of the
					new millennium enriched by the wisdom of great thinkers and educators
					like Tagore and Vivekananda and the dreams of scientist and educator
					Stephen Hawkings. Achieving excellence through human values is the
					goal of this School. The school is a unique experiment and honest
					endeavor aiming at man-making education for building a dynamic society
					by developing the personality of the child towards fullness. It is by
					helping the child in the manifestation of the perfection already
					existing in the child and by creating an environment where the child
					can recognize "the angle of surplus" that he is. Integral Education
					for fullness is ensured by developing his physical, intellectual,
					emotional and spiritual qualities in a balanced form, so that the
					child can blossom as a multi lotus in its pristine glory under the
					ever-purifying, constantly ever rising Sun. The manifestation of the
					perfection already existing in the child-the blossoming of the
					"Integral", i.e. his physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual
					faculties.
